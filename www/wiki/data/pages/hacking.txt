===== Set up =====

==== Full, fresh source ====

Most up to date copy of PHPTAL's code can be found in SVN repository: ''https://svn.motion-twin.com/phptal/trunk''. Use this code rather than one provided in releases:

    svn co https://svn.motion-twin.com/phptal/trunk phptal

==== Tests ====

PHPTAL has a big tests suite that helps you ensure that your changes don't break anything (this is //very// helpful). To run the tests you'll need to install [[http://www.phpunit.de/|PHPUnit]]:

    pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

If you're getting permission errors, run each command with ''sudo''. If that doesn't work, you can [[http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html|install PHPUnit manually]].

To run tests, execute:

   php tests/run-test.php

===== Patches =====

If you've made a change you'd like to share (and get accepted into official PHPTAL distribution):

  * Ensure all tests pass.
  * Create patch by running following command in directory with PHPTAL code:

   svn diff > my_awesome_change.patch


  * Send the patch to [[http://phptal.org/contact.html|mailing list or PHPTAL's maintainer]].
