====== Custom cache ======

> This page contains design of future improvements to caching. Only basic syntax works in current releases.

Current syntax is:

   phptal:cache="<time> per url"

or

   phptal:cache="<time> per <expresssion>"

Where ''%%<time>%%'' is ''1m'', ''1h'', ''1d'', etc.

===== Problems =====

You can easily cache per URL //and// another variable (this requires definition of temporary variable and/or getting current URL passed to the template).

It could be solved by using

    phptal:cache="<time>;? per <url|expresssion> [; per <url|expression>]* "

e.g.

    phptal:cache="1h; per url; per user/id"


===== Desired features =====

PHPTAL needs cache "plugins" to be able to use APC, memcached and other caching mechanisms.


What should be interface of this class?

What information plugins need? Should they parse phptal:cache expression or only parsed and processed data?
