====== Lint tool ======

Lint allows you to check syntax of templates (XML well-formedness) without running them. It is useful to run after [[Upgrading|upgrade]] of PHPTAL to ensure that everything still works. You can also use it in SVN pre-commit hook to prevent ill-formed templates from being committed to your repository.

===== Installation =====

==== Unix & Mac OS X ====


You can copy ''phptal_lint.php'' to directory in your path (e.g. ''/usr/local/bin''). Run ''echo $PATH'' to see which directories you have in path.

Or you can run it by always specifying full path to the ''phptal_lint.php'' file (most terminals support drag'n'drop, so just drop ''phptal_lint.php'' file into terminal window instead of typing entire path).

If you're getting errors that ''phptal_lint.php'' is not executable:

''chmod a+rx /full/path/to/phptal_lint.php''

If you're getting errors about missing interpreter, then use:

 ''//php /full/path/to///phptal_lint.php'' 

to run the tool.

==== Windows ====

   C:\path\to\php.exe C:\path\to\phptal_lint.php

Running of this tool from ''%PATH%'' requires writing DOS batch file that passes arguments appropriately.

===== Usage =====

   phptal_lint.php [-e extensions] [-i php_file_or_directory] file_or_directory_to_check ...



    * **''-e''** comma-separated list of file extensions you use for templates
    * **''-i''** path to PHP file or directory of PHP files to include (this is needed to check against your [[http://phptal.org/manual/en/split/custom-modifiers.html|custom TALES modifiers]])

===== Examples =====

  phptal_lint.php .

Scan current directory for all templates (templates are recognized by popular file extensions). [[http://phptal.org/manual/en/split/custom-modifiers.html|TALES modifiers]] (as in ''%%${mycustommodifier:foo/bar}%%'') will be ignored.

  phptal_lint.php -e xhtml,zpt,tal,phtml -i myproject/includes/phptalmodifiers.php myproject/templates/

Checks only ''*.xhtml'', ''*.zpt'', ''*.tal'' and ''*.phtml'' files in ''myproject/templates/''. Will load ''myproject/includes/phptalmodifiers.php'' file first assuming it defines all TALES modifiers used by the templates.
