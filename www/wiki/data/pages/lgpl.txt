====== PHPTAL Licence ======

PHPTAL is licensed under [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html|LGPL]] (v2.1 or later). 

===== Use in commercial projects =====

The licence does not "infect" other software you use with PHPTAL, so it's safe for commercial (closed, for-profit) use in PHP applications.

  * You **can** use it in commercial applications.

  * Your website and your templates **remain your property** and are unaffected by the license.

  * You **can** redistribute PHPTAL with applications, even if they're not free/open-source. 

===== Your obligations =====

**You only have obligations if you //redistribute// PHPTAL** (give PHPTAL's source code to others). Sending of PHPTAL-generated HTML from a server doesn't count as redistribution. 

  * If you //modify and redistribute// PHPTAL, then your modifications of PHPTAL's code (and only PHPTAL's code) become LGPL-licensed.\\ However, if you always keep PHPTAL only on your server, then you're allowed to keep your modifications secret.

  * If you redistribute your application to others with PHPTAL built-in, it must be possible to modify PHPTAL part of the application. If you use copy protection (encryption/obfuscation of PHP files), don't apply it to PHPTAL files.

  * Don't remove license (''COPYING'' file) from PHPTAL copies you give to others.
